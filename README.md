# AI-Powered-Voice-Assistant
A Python-based voice assistant that uses AI, speech recognition, and text-to-speech to perform tasks like weather updates, email sending, and answering questions.
We developed an AI-powered voice assistant using Python that integrates speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech functionality. The assistant listens to user commands through the microphone, processes the input using Google's speech recognition, and generates responses using OpenAI's GPT model. We incorporated features like fetching real-time weather updates, sending emails via SMTP, playing music on YouTube, and providing AI-generated answers to user queries. The project uses libraries like pyttsx3 for speech output, speech_recognition for voice input, and requests for weather data, providing an interactive, hands-free user experience.
